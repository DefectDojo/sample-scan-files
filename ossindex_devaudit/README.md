## About

DevAudit is an open-source, cross-platform, multi-purpose security auditing tool targeted at developers and teams adopting DevOps and DevSecOps that detects security vulnerabilities at multiple levels of the solution stack. DevAudit provides a wide array of auditing capabilities that automate security practices and implementation of security auditing in the software development life-cycle. DevAudit can scan your operating system and application package dependencies, application and application server configurations, and application code, for potential vulnerabilities based on data aggregated by providers like OSS Index and Vulners from a wide array of sources and data feeds such as the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) CVE data feed, the Debian Security Advisories data feed, Drupal Security Advisories, and many others.

DevAudit helps developers address at least 4 of the OWASP Top 10 risks to web application development:

- A9 Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities
- A5 Security Misconfiguration
- A6 Sensitive Data Exposure
- A2 Broken Authentication and Session Management

as well as risks classified by MITRE in the CWE dictionary such as CWE-2 Environment and CWE-200 Information Disclosure
